Titanic_EDA

This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset provided by Kaggle. The goal is to uncover insights, visualize patterns, and prepare the dataset for further machine learning tasks such as classification.
Overview:

The Titanic dataset contains information about the passengers who were aboard the RMS Titanic. Through this EDA, we explore relationships between features and survival outcomes, missing value handling, and visualizations to better understand the structure of the data.

Dataset

Source: Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

Files Used:

train.csv

test.csv



EDA Objectives :

Understand the structure and distribution of data.

Handle missing values and outliers.

Visualize relationships between variables.

Explore categorical vs numerical features.

Identify factors affecting survival.


Technologies Used:

Python 3.x

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook


Key Insights:

Females had a higher survival rate than males.

Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive.

Younger passengers had better survival chances.

Certain ports of embarkation had higher survival rates.


How to Run:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Tejaswinikuppili/Titanic_EDA.git


2. Navigate to the project folder:

cd Titanic_EDA


3. Install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Titanic_EDA.ipynb



Results

Visualizations and cleaned data help form a foundation for further machine learning modeling. The notebook provides plots such as:

Survival distribution by gender, class, and age

Missing data heatmaps

Correlation heatmaps


Conclusions

This EDA reveals critical patterns and prepares the Titanic dataset for predictive modeling. It emphasizes the importance of data visualization and preprocessing in the data science workflow.
